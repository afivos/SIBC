			<h4>Part 1: Greetings from Rhyl</h4>
			<h5>‘Design your vehicles’</h5>

			<p>The initial stage of this project is concerned with researching
			and understanding Rhyl and its citizens. You are asked to identify spaces or communities of interest (fashion culture, mobile shops, community groups) within Rhyl and design an expanded ‘vehicle’ to allow you to engage with them.</p>

			<p>The ‘data’ generated by your vehicle can be reviewed, altered and revised before, during and after the initial ‘ride’.
			The ‘drive’ (direction, destination and passengers) of your vehicle can be reviewed, altered and revised before, during and after the initial ‘ride’.</p>

			<p>Field trip and deployment; Design in the wild
			Once you have designed your vehicle, it’s time for a test drive. Your trip to Rhyl will allow you to understand the town and its occupants. But remember; things may go wrong. Have a plan B (C and D). Be prepared to react when plans collapse.</p>

			<h4>Part 2: Twin Towns</h4>
			<h5>'Underdogs and Industries’</h5>

			<p>During this section of the project you are asked to locate and identify a ‘twin town’. Twin Towns were used after the Second World War to “foster friendship and understanding between different cultures and between former foes as an act of peace and reconciliation, and to encourage trade and tourism”. What does this mean in a global, networked, post-BREXIT world? How do we form new relationships to prepare us for a troubled future?</p>

			<h4>Part 3: Future Strategies</h4>
			<h5>‘Designing schemes and possibilities’</h5>

			<p>The final phase of the project asks you to design, visualise and represent new possible futures for Rhyl and your twin town. The proposals must be clearly linked to the communities and people you met during your initial stage. Your design process should demonstrate how you’ve listened, evolved and imagined a set of scenarios that materialise the ambition and dreams of your chosen communities. The aims of these proposals is to give a voice (and a level of visual resolution) to ideas that normally don’t get taken seriously.</p>

			<h4>Part 4: Reinsertation Into Reality</h4>

			<p>As an additional stage to the project, the most successful projects will be asked to return to Rhyl and present their work to the communities that inspired them. By tracking and assessing their response to your work, we hope to build a greater understanding of how we represent the most diverse futures possible.</p>
